More importantly Singapore indian nifty ended in negative note , so no stock specification action as of now for trading.
<br><br>
<b>Learning curve:</b><br>   1.Bitcoin has no regulated trading exchange and it is traded 24/7.<br> 
2. Let see how long legged doji reacts with price action Tomorrow.
 <br>
<b>Notification:</b> Soon updation and Learning curve will be posted in blog . Will update on the same.
